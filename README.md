## Usage

### Notes
- Loading up the tool may take some time, please be patient (or come and help refactor code to speed it up ^_^)
- Using the admin level map will be rather laggy, so for most purposes rather use national level map
- Double click legend label to edit (click elsewhere or press Enter to finish editing)
- Added new time points inherit the map of the previous time point (makes timeline mapping easier)
- To use offline, you'll need to setup a local server and then open the main.html there

### Possible uses
- Alternate history timeline making OFC ^_^
- Creating coloured maps in general with annotations, for say demographics and so on

## Extra Acknowledgements
- geoJSON had data originally from Natural Earth (https://www.naturalearthdata.com) and converted to geoJSON at https://geoconverter.hsr.ch/vector
