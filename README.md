# alternate-history-editor

## Planned functionalities
- [ ] Timeline editor (each time point specified will have corresponding map; by default map of new time point inherits those of preceding time point)
- [ ] Border/map editor (for now use a premade provincial/territorial overlay map over blank world map); effectively just a paint editor allowing for colour fill with a legend functionality for colours
- [ ] Exportable to common formats (e.g. timeline to txt, timeline & corresponding maps to word, etc.)

## Possible future additional changes
- Different map layers (e.g. terrain, population density, etc.)
- More parameter customisation, e.g.
  - Flag
  - Population
  - GDP
- GIF generation of timeline (so like those border youtube videos)
- Loading previously made timelines
